Project Overview:
This project is a simple password generator and password strength checker implemented using Flask for the backend and HTML with inline CSS for the frontend.

Files:
app.py: This is the main Python script implementing the Flask web application. It has two main functions - generate_password and check_password_strength.
index.html: This HTML file contains the structure and styling for the web page. It includes two sections for generating a password and checking password strength.

Project Structure:
The web page has two main sections, each enclosed in a div with the class password-section. These sections are responsible for generating passwords and checking password strength.
The styling is done using CSS to make the page visually appealing, with a gaming-style appearance.
The Flask app (app.py) has three routes: /, /generate-password, and /check-password. The root route (/) renders the HTML page, and the other two routes handle the generation of passwords and checking password strength, respectively.

How to Run:

pip install Flask
